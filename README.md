# Password Generator Assignment

The assignment in this challenge was to create a program to randomly generate a password according to user inputted variables.

First, I created several prompts to ask the user to input the desired length of the password and the desired characters in the password (i.e. lower case letters, numbers).

Then, I created arrays to hold each of the characters and built a function that would randomly selected characters from the arrays according to the user inputs. Then, I created a function that would place the randomly generated password into the textbox.
